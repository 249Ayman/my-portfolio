During my senior year of high school, I was given the behemoth task of planning a trip to Japan for my immediate family of four. The idea was my Mom’s——I was given absolutely nothing to work with, except for the general time interval which was feasible (the summer of 2023) alongside the guttural desire to go. Although I happily obliged, since I was the most “knowledgeable” about internet research and the culture, I quickly realized that being the one to plan came with both responsibilities and accountability.
Paying close attention to the right side of this graphic, we can see that there’s only a couple specific points at which we can interact with the server: when we pick the n and m to send, and when we guess the value of x. The question now is: what values should we be picking for n and m which reveal the most information about x, and how do we use this information to obtain its actual value?
You may be asking: what the hell does this have to do with guessing the giant integer that we’ve been given? Well, I’ve concocted a little example here to demonstrate how we can use this theorem to our advantage.
