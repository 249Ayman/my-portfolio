This theme was developed during my free time, and the documentation may not be comprehensive enough, but I will try my best to explain it.

### Prerequisite

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed in your development environment:

- :link[Node.js]{id=https://nodejs.org/en/download} - Required for running the development environment
- :link[pnpm]{id=https://pnpm.io/installation} - Our preferred package manager for dependency management
- :link[Git]{id=https://git-scm.com/} - For version control and project management
- :link[VS Code]{id=https://code.visualstudio.com/} - Recommended code editor with excellent development experience

> [!NOTE]
> While VS Code is recommended, you can use any code editor of your choice that supports web development.
