Stop what you are doing. Seriously, put down the coffee, pause the Spotify playlist, and listen up. React just got hit with a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability, and it's a big one—rated **CVSS 10.0**.

If you are running React Server Components (RSC), specifically with frameworks like Next.js or React Router, you need to patch this **right now**.

## The Panic Button (CVE-2025-55182)

On December 3rd, 2025, the React team disclosed **CVE-2025-55182**.

In simple terms: An unauthenticated attacker can send a malicious HTTP request to your React Server Function endpoints. Because of a flaw in how React decodes these payloads, that request can trick your server into executing arbitrary code.

Yes, that means an attacker could potentially take full control of your server without even logging in.

### Who is Vulnerable?

You are likely at risk if you use **React Server Components** in versions:

- `19.0`
- `19.1.0`, `19.1.1`
- `19.2.0`

This impacts the underlying packages:

- `react-server-dom-webpack`
- `react-server-dom-parcel`
- `react-server-dom-turbopack`

Consequently, popular frameworks are affected, including:

- **Next.js** (Versions 15 through 16)
- **React Router**
- **Waku**
- **RedwoodJS**

> **Note:** If your app is purely client-side (SPA) and doesn't use a server or RSC-supporting bundler, you are safe. But if you aren't sure, check your `package.json`.

## The Fix: Upgrade Immediately

The React team and framework maintainers have already pushed fixes. You need to upgrade your dependencies to the patched versions: `19.0.1`, `19.1.2`, or `19.2.1`.

Here is how to fix it based on your framework:

### Next.js Users

Run the update for your specific version line:

```bash
# For Next.js 15.0.x
npm install next@15.0.5

# For Next.js 15.1.x
npm install next@15.1.9

# For Next.js 15.2.x
npm install next@15.2.6

# For Next.js 16.0.x
npm install next@16.0.7
```

## React Router Users

If you are using unstable RSC APIs, update your core React dependencies:

```bash
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest react-server-dom-webpack@latest
```

## Waku & Others

Generally, nuke your node_modules and grab the latest stable release of your framework and React:

```bash
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
```

## Extra Protection (Cloudflare WAF)

If you are behind Cloudflare, you might have some breathing room. Cloudflare has already deployed WAF rules to block these malicious requests for all customers (Free and Paid).

- Rule ID: 33aa8a8a948b48b28d40450c5fb92fba (Managed Ruleset)
- Rule ID: 2b5d06e34a814a889bee9a0699702280 (Free Ruleset)

However, do not rely solely on the WAF. It's a safety net, not a cure. Patch your code.

## Summary

1. Check your versions.

2. Run npm install to get the latest patches.

3. Deploy immediately.

Security incidents like this are scary, but the fix is straightforward. Go patch your stuff!
