During my senior year of high school, I was given the behemoth task of planning a trip to Japan for my immediate family of four. The idea was my Mom’s——I was given absolutely nothing to work with, except for the general time interval which was feasible (the summer of 2023) alongside the guttural desire to go. Although I happily obliged, since I was the most “knowledgeable” about internet research and the culture, I quickly realized that being the one to plan came with both responsibilities and accountability.
